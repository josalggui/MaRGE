# MaRGE (MaRCoS Graphical Environment)

🚀 **Version 1.0.0 coming soon — stay tuned!**

**MaRGE** is a Python-based graphical environment for interacting with the **MaRCoS MRI research system**. It provides a user-friendly GUI for running MRI sequences, configuring parameters, and managing experiments without needing to work directly with low-level control code.

MaRGE is designed for MRI researchers, developers, and students working with the MaRCoS platform.
