# MaRGE (MaRCoS Graphical Environment)

🚀 **Version 1.0.0 coming soon… stay tuned!**

## Installation with pip
A fast installation can be done using pip.
But note that pip installation only works with red pitayas configured with static IP 192.168.1.101.
You can install **MaRGE** using pip:

```bash
pip install marge-mri
```

Then, you can launch the GUI with:

```python
# Import marge
from marge import main

# Run MaRGE
main.MaRGE()
```

## Installation from source

Alternatively, if you prefer to download from source and have full access to the code, simply clone this repository:

```bash
git clone --branch pypi_integration --single-branch https://github.com/josalggui/MaRGE.git
```
Create your virtual environment and install all the requirements with

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Notes

This repository contains the Python code for the MaRCoS Graphical Environment (MaRGE), a system for magnetic resonance imaging research. The GUI provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the MaRCoS system.
